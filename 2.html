 <h2> <strong>Geography</strong> </h2>
<p> Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe,
  Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited
  area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi).[44] The population is about 8 million,
  resulting in an average population density of around 195 people per square kilometre
  (500/sq mi).[44][45] The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more
  sparsely populated than the northern half.[44] In the largest Canton of Graubünden,
  lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 27 /km² (70 /sq mi).</p>

  belongs to Germany, Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy.[48] Switzerland has no
  exclaves in other countries.</p>
