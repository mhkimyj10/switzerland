 <h2> <strong>HISTORY</strong> </h2>
<p> The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity for the population
  living on the <u><strong>Swiss plateau</strong></u>. Several towns, like <a href="Aventicumhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventicum" target=_"blank" title="cities">Aventicum</a>, Iulia Equestris and
  Augusta Raurica, reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates
    (Villae rusticae) were founded in the countryside.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px">Throughout the rest of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries
  the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian
  dynasties).But after its extension under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire was
  divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.[25] The territories of present-day Switzerland
  became divided   into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified
  under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD.[25] </p>
