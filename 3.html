<p><u><strong> Switzerland has four national languages: mainly German (spoken by 62.8% of the
   population in 2016); French (22.9%) in the west; and Italian (8.2%) in the south.
   The fourth national language, Romansh (0.5%), is a Romance language spoken locally
   in the southeastern trilingual canton of Grisons, and is designated by Article 4
   of the Federal Constitution as a national language along with German, French,
   and Italian, and in Article 70 as an official language if the authorities
   communicate with persons who speak Romansh. However, federal laws and other
   official acts do not need to be decreed in Romansh</strong> </u> </p>
